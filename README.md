#Lilypot's Library#
*This is so much more than just a library on wheels.* 

#UX/UE:#

##Why do we need Lilypot's Library?##
The need for a project like this to come to fruition has been driven by the heartbreaking year-on-year closures of stationary libraries, the economic cost of illiteracy rates and the lack of access to such facilities in neglected communities all over the country. This is about the future and we cannot keep making the same mistakes for the next generation to inherit. 

##What should users take away from this website?##
This is where communities can engage with each other, arrange meetings to acquire information about further learning opportunities and support they require to achieve this. This is also for parents who for whatever reason do not have the funds to get their kids off to a great start with their nutrition by partnering with local food banks. These same kids can return to us after school to take part in homework club and other extra-curricular activities. We will give everyone access to resources they need to complete studies and tasks. 

#Why did I use the technologies?#
Firstly, I used html and css because these are mandatory requirements but I have also tried to include various bits and bobs from Bootstrap to differentiate between my own project and that of the walkthroughs I've done. They have been acknowledged at the bottom of this readme file.

#Project Challenges & Features:#
The biggest challenge with this project was having to put this together in a matter of days after the previous client both pulled out and killed the project. Now I see why my mentor suggested a fortnight as a comfortable amount of time. 

The second biggest challenge were the tiny errors I made when I tried running the editor and the webpage was blank. They were small enough to fix and yet their impact superseeded their size. I soon realised it was because I didn't have links to the pages and later my css contained in the assets directory.

The third biggest challenge were the image links failing to work. I worked backwards from the problem and googled how to acquire a jpeg/png link and then when that didn't work I went straight back to where they were stored only to find they'd vanished. Odd I thought, so I reuploaded them and now they work. Thank goodness for small victories, eh? It's a good job I weirdly enjoy de-pickling my own bugs. 

Features I would install would probably be: the opportunity to allow users to have an account with us where it would detail a personalised overview of what it is they personally require from us. It would include information about interests, time constraints (working-childcare-free time), whether they have a learning difficulty and need additional support, and pick which purpose point applies to their needs. I've yet to acquire these technical skills but I'd be more than happy to return at a later date and apply them. I'd also have a donation tab tacked onto the sign-up page for users to contribute if they wanted to. It's worth pointing out at this stage that e-commerce skills have yet to be mastered. This wouldn't be the only source of income, the mobile library would welcome as sharing the refurbishing build of the fleet of buses on social media would establish an early-interest in the business.

I wanted to combine the warmth of one walkthrough project on this Code Institute course with the structure and simple design features of another:
Coder's Coffeehouse - The warmth and friendly nature of a coffeehouse. 
Love Running - The simple and effective structure with easy navigational links. 
For the cards, they are by my grandma's extraordinarily artistic hand. I wish I was naturally inbued with her level of talent but some things cannot be taught. 
For the main image on index.html, I have my parents to thank for that because my list of 20 images did not project the message I wanted it to carry. The one they helped me decide to use I initially showed to them for no other reason than I thought it was punny (not a typo).
